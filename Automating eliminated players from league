#Removing players from league using selenium
#I do this for a classic league only, not H2H, so use at own risk

#Step 1: Install Selenium and important packages
# Selenium import
#pip install selenium
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time
driver= webdriver.Chrome(r'C:\Users\ccicone.04stang\Documents\Python Scripts\chromedriver.exe')

#Step 2: J-Query
#You need to download jquery for this step. I believe I downloaded it locally and then installed it from the download
def goUrl(url):
    #navigate to url
    driver.get(url) 
    # load jquery 
    with open(r'PATH\Python Scripts\jquery-3.2.1.js', 'r') as jquery_js:         
        # read and parse jquery lib
        driver.execute_script( jquery_js.read() ) 
    return# helper function that navigates to a page, and then reads jquery from disk
   
#Step 3: Try to go to the admin page of your league. FPL should redirect you to login page
# use goUrl function to navigate to url and inject jquery
# replace LEAGUEID with you league's ID
goUrl("https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/LEAGUEID/admin/c")

#Step 4: Login
driver.implicitly_wait(1)
# Find the HTML element for username, and fill in your name- replace USERNAME and PASSWORD on lines 34 and 35
myName = 'USERNAME'
myPassword = 'PASSWORD!'
# fill out username and password
#use the ID field. inspect page, then find the specific field. Right click and copy JS, it gave the loginUsername/Password 
driver.execute_script("$('#loginUsername').val('" + myName + "')")
driver.execute_script("$('#loginPassword').val('" + myPassword + "')")

# click submit button- inspected the button and copy xpath value- I imagine this is the same for everyone;
driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="root"]/div[2]/div/div/div[1]/form/div[3]/button').click()

#Step 5: Eliminate players from league
#enter in list of eliminated people in the losers list on line 47. The format must be firstname lastname (teamname) as that is how FPL formats dropdown values
#Ex. Manager firstname=Pablo,  lastname=Chicone, teamname=Test, see line 47. Also note that whatever manager name is, must be identical match.
losers=['Pablo Chicone (Test)']
#go through list of losers and manually remove them from the league
for loser in losers:
    # use goUrl function to navigate to url and inject jquery into the admin page; replace LEAGUEID with your specific league ID
    goUrl("https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/LEAGUEID/admin/c")
    time.sleep(1)
    #send manager info
    driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="downshift-0-label"]').send_keys(loser)
    #send space bar to get FPL site to create dropdown box
    driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="downshift-0-label"]').send_keys(Keys.SPACE)
    #wait until drop down appears
    time.sleep(2)
    text=[]
    #FPL matches on first name only, so if multiple managers share same firstname, a list of managers forms. Go through list until exact match and then eliminate
    #if 2 managers have same first name, last name, and team name, then this code will eliminate the first in the list. Not sure how to address that issue
    i=0
    while str(loser) != str(text):
        try:
            xpathy='//*[@id="downshift-0-item-'+ str(i)+'"]'
            text = driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpathy).text
            if str(text)==str(loser):
                #select loser from dropdown that appears
                driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpathy).click()
                time.sleep(1)
                #click suspend player button
                driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="root"]/div[2]/div/div/div/form[2]/div[2]/button').click()
                print(loser)
                break
            #choose number of names in the dropdown you want to check before giving up
            #stops infinite loop if unable to locate player to suspend after i iterations- I think unnecessary because of try and except statements now
            #elif i==5:
                #print(loser + ' failed to remove')
                #break
            else:
                i=i+1
        except:
            #if code fails, show which player was not removed so you have list of manual removals
            print(loser + ' failed to remove')
            break
